# DSA-Documentation
#Some weeks ago, I enrolled in Data Analysis course with THE INCUBATOR HUB through DIGITAL SKILL UP AFRICA (DSA). 
It has been an amazing session learning from different teachers, connecting with new colleagues.
The teacher ensure we understand what was tought in class, participate by practicalizing with our PC. 
During the sessions, i learnt how to use Microsoft Excel, SQL, Microsoft power BI, Tableau. And i can boldly carry out analysis on data.
